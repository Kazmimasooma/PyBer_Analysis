# The written Analysis 

# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

V. Isualize has assigned a new task to me and Omar. I will generate a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using the Python abilities and understanding of Pandas. Then, with the help of Pandas and Matplotlib, I will make a multi-line graph that displays the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, In this written report I will be summarising how the data differs by city type and how PyBer decision-makers may exploit those distinctions. 

## Results: 

The disparities in ride-sharing statistics between the various sorts of cities. Total trips, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type are all included in ride-sharing statistics. 

###### Rural: 

In rurual area total rides are 125, total drivers are 78 and total fares are 4,327.93. The average fare per ride is $34.62 and Average fare per Driver is $55.49.

###### Suburban: 

In Suburban area total rides are 625, total drivers are 490 and total fares are 19,356.33. The average fare per ride is $30.97 and Average fare per Driver is $39.50.

###### Urban: 

 In Urban area total rides are 1625, total drivers are 2,405 and total fares are 39,854.38. The average fare per ride is $24.53 and Average fare per Driver is $16.57.
 
This explains that urban area avarage fare per ride and average fare per dirver is reasonable compare to rural and suburban area. But urban has more population who takes advanatage of rides. In rural and suburban the population is small so many people dont prefer to take rides.

###### Total fare by City Type:

Total fare depends on the city Type. 

In urban the fares were highest in the months of Feb and March
In Suburban the fares were lower than urban. Their highest fares for suburban were in the month of Jan and feb 
In Rural the fares were lower than suburban and urban. Their Highest fare for rural were in the months of Feb and April.

## Summary: 

After reviewing the anaylsis. I like to summarize that urban area avarage fare per ride and average fare per dirver is reasonable compare to rural and suburban area. But urban has more population who takes advanatage of rides and in rural and suburban the population is small so many people dont prefer to take rides. In Rural the fares were lower than suburban and urban area.
